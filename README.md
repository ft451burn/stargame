## Gameplay

Navigate your spaceship through an asteroid field, shooting asteroids to gain points. Each asteroid destroyed is worth 100 points. 

When you destroy asteroids, there's a chance (20%) of spawning a power-up. Collect these to gain temporary advantages:

- Weapon upgrade: More powerful bullets that deal double damage and fire faster
- Shield: Temporary protection from asteroid collisions
- Extra life: Adds one life to your count
- Speed boost: Increases your maximum thrust

The game ends when you lose all your lives by colliding with asteroids.
